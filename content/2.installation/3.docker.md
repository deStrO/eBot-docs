# Docker

Docker setup is the simplest way to install eBot for now.

You clone the project, configure the vars, and then run the containers via docker-compose.

```bash
mkdir /home/ebot
git clone git@github.com:deStrO/eBot-docker.git
cp .env.sample .env
chmod a+x setup.sh configure.sh
./setup.sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Soon, there will be an image of eBot. For now, those images are built locally.


## Manual Configuration

You skip the ./setup.sh step and configure everything on your own.

The .env file must be configured, as the environment variables are used by the containers.


## Docker Image

A fresh docker image is coming soon.

## Note for ARM

Please follow this guide in order to get eBot running under Docker with ARM :
