# Getting Started

Before installing **[eBot]{.text-primary}**, you must understand some core concepts of the setup and the game.

## What's **[eBot]{.text-primary}** ?

::list
- CS2 (and previously CSGO) match manager
- It uses only RCON to connect to the server
- Listening the logs via HTTP only
- Interacting only via chat command for the players
- Provide statistics for the match / tournament
- Using a plugin "CSay" to provide more RCON utilities
- Can be installed on a different server than the game server.
::


## What's not **[eBot]{.text-primary}** ?

::list{type="danger"}
- A server plugin
- Single match manager
::

## Architecture

**[eBot]{.text-primary}** is composed of 3 separated parts :

- The main application : this is the brain, it connect to the server, parse the logs and manage the match
- The logs receiver : it collect the logs from the game servers and then dispatch to a queue
- The web application : this is where you can create matches, control them or simply check the statistics.

Those 3 parts are split in 3 differents projects for now :

- [eBot-CSGO](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO)
- [ebot-project](https://github.com/deStrO/ebot-project)
- [eBot-CSGO-Web](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO-Web)

Currently, eBot is dispatching the logs to a redis queue.

The logs-receiver (ebot-project) can be run on another server than the eBot one.

## RCON & logs

**[eBot]{.text-primary}** is simple : it just connect to your game server via RCON, and known what happens on the server by the logs.

Your CS2 server only need to be reachable from **[eBot]{.text-primary}**, and your CS2 server must reach your logs-receiver. 
There are no more complex setup due to UDP forwarding or pain with IP mapping, **[eBot]{.text-primary}** send the logs with the IP of the server.
