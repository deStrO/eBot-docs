## Common issues

### It says eBot offline / Websocket offline

There are 3 things to check :

1. Is eBot running ? Just simple check that the bootstrap.php is running. 
2. Is websocket server running ? Check with a ```ps aux | grep websocket``` that you have a process running. 
3. Is the IP configured in the eBot-Web/config/app_user.yml is reachable from your computer ? 

Remember, if you change a configuration in the eBot-Web, you will need to clear the cache with ```php symfony cc```

### The match doesn't start
