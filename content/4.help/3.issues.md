Don't forget to check in the logs, the errors are always there ;)

## Where to find logs

There are multiple logs that you can check.

In ebot-app :
- logs/websocket.error
- logs/websocket.logs

In ebot-web :
- your web server logs

## Common issues

### It says eBot offline / Websocket offline

There are 3 things to check:

1. Is eBot running? Just simply check that the bootstrap.php is running. 
2. Is websocket server running? Check with a ```ps aux | grep websocket``` that you have a process running. 
3. Is the IP configured in the eBot-Web/config/app_user.yml reachable from your computer? 

Remember, if you change configuration in the eBot-Web, you will need to clear the cache with ```php symfony cc```

### The match doesn't start

There can be multiple reasons, but here is what you can check:

1. Is eBot running? Just simply check that the bootstrap.php is running. 
2. Is the CS2 server running?
3. Is the CS2 server reachable from the eBot server?
4. Is RCON enabled on the server?
5. Is the RCON password correct?

If you checked all of these, and it still does not work, contact us on Discord.
